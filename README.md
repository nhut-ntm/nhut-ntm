# Hi there üëã! Welcome to my Github profile

I am Nhut Nguyen (Kenny Nguyen), an undergraduate in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

# About me
I am a senior at University of Economics and Law (UEL) based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. My major is Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence so that I have knowledge of both worlds, business and engineering. My business knowledge ranges from Economics, Accounting to Marketing. I also have solid experiences of exploring data including data manipulating, data visualization, performing statistical analysis, and building machine learning models.

I can communicate effectively in both Vietnamese (mother tongue) and English. I am also a good problem solver, and have taken leadership roles in several projects and achieved significant results.

I am currently seeking for a data analyst role. My main objective is to contribute to the development of the organization I join, bring values to my teams, and develop myself to a better version of it day by day.

# What I have done and enjoy doing 
- I mainly write code in Python. I also know R and SQL but occasionally use them. These are the two languages I am currently working on to improve my skills. 
- Time series analysis and forecasting: I have experiences in doing statistical analysis and modelling for time series data and also utilizing some machine learning models for forecasting time series
- Machine Learning: I have some experiences building models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- I have some experiences with Robotic Process Automation, with tools like UiPath and Python open-source tool called Robocorp.
- I am looking into Generative AI, specifically LLMs, as I think they are real game changers.
